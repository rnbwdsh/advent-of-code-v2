# All my advent of code solutions so far

## TODO

Fix
* 2019/16
* 2019/18
* 2019/19
* 2019/25
* 2018 -> nim to py
* 2017 -> redo in py
* 2016 -> go to py

## Why

My [previous AoC repo](https://github.com/rnbwdsh/advent-of-code) was a mess, and I wanted to bring everything to a standardized format in python.

To see how my programming skills evolve over time, and to learn pytest

I'd also later like to use this as LLM training data

## How to use

* Install the dependencies mentioned in pyproject.toml
* Run `pytest` in any year-directory. Use -n 32 for parallelism
